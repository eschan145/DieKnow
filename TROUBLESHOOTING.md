**Problem**: the DieKnow window is intended to start up and display the screen as shown in the video. Sometimes, an organization may have a specific policy blocking PowerShell from running, therefore the window shows up and then closes immediately.

**Solution**:

This solution involves running the Python script directly without the use of PowerShell which may be blocked.

1. Open the DieKnow directory
2. Open the `src/` folder within the DieKnow directory
3. Find the `main.py` file and double-click it to run. A window may open asking which app to start the file. In that case, press "Python" and then "Ok"
4. Run the DieKnow shell by typing `start` and then `<Enter>` as usual.
